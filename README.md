guix-workflows
==============

This repository contains workflows that can be run using the GWL.
See the [GWL repository page](https://www.guixwl.org) for how to
get started.

This repository's intent is to be an archive for workflow scripts used
at some point.  The workflows are not maintained or published elsewhere,
so this is their new home.  You can use them to cherry-pick code snippets
or ideas from.
